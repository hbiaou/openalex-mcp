**1. Research and Reference Gathering**

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Resources**  
  - Review the MCP introduction, quickstart, examples, building-with-LLMs tutorials, tools (inspector), and architecture documentation from the provided links:  
    - [MCP Introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)  
    - [MCP Quickstart / Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server)  
    - [MCP Examples](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples)  
    - [MCP Building with LLMs Tutorial](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/tutorials/building-mcp-with-llms)  
    - [MCP Inspector Tool Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)  
    - [MCP Architecture Concepts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)  
  - Identify any recent updates or version changes, noting revisions in protocol behavior, recommended practices for server setup, and integration expectations.

- **OpenAlex API Resources**  
  - Review the OpenAlex API documentation to understand rate limits, endpoints, query parameters, and example usage:  
    - [OpenAlex API Overview](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/api-overview)  
  - Note best practices for handling academic literature queries, such as caching strategies, query composition, and error handling.

**2. Development and Configuration Plan**

- **Project Setup (Development Environment Configuration)**
  - **Directory Structure:**  
    - Use the current project directory (C:\2Projects\openalex-mcp) to house the server code.
    - Create dedicated subdirectories (e.g., /src for source code, /tests for tests, and /docs for documentation).
  - **Dependencies and Frameworks:**  
    - Choose a backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express or Python with Flask/FastAPI) based on team preference.
    - Configure package/dependency management (e.g., npm init for Node.js or virtualenv with pip for Python).
    - Include libraries for HTTP requests that communicate with the OpenAlex API (e.g., Axios for Node.js or requests in Python).
    - Incorporate logging (e.g., Winston for Node.js or Python’s logging module) and environment variable management (e.g., dotenv).

- **Server Configuration and Initialization**
  - **Configuration Files:**  
    - Create a configuration file (e.g., config.json or .env) to store API keys, base URLs (e.g., OpenAlex endpoint), port numbers, and logging settings.
  - **Server Initialization:**  
    - Outline the main server file (e.g., server.js or app.py) that initializes middleware, sets up routes, and integrates error handling.
  - **Interface Design for MCP:**  
    - Implement or configure the MCP server based on the MCP quickstart guide.  
    - Ensure that the MCP context handling (e.g., model input/output wiring) is appropriately set up to support writing academic query logic.

- **Integration with OpenAlex API**
  - **API Communication:**  
    - Build a module/library for handling API requests to OpenAlex.
    - Ensure robust error handling (timeout, rate limiting, network errors) and incorporate retries or circuit breaker patterns as necessary.
  - **Academic Literature Search Logic:**  
    - Develop endpoints that accept search parameters from the user, query the OpenAlex API, parse results, and return standardized responses.
    - Consider caching frequent queries to optimize performance.
  - **Documentation:**  
    - Annotate code and modules with comments explaining design decisions and link to relevant sections in OpenAlex and MCP documentation.

**3. Testing Procedures**

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for individual modules (e.g., the OpenAlex API wrapper and MCP integration functions).
  - Employ testing frameworks such as Mocha/Chai for Node.js or Pytest for Python.
  - Include tests for valid inputs, error cases, and edge conditions.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Develop integration tests simulating end-to-end interactions between the MCP server and the OpenAlex API.
  - Use tools like Postman or automated test scripts that mimic real API calls.
  - Validate that the server correctly translates user queries into API calls, handles responses, and gracefully manages API rate limits or failures.

- **Debugging and Performance Testing:**
  - Enable detailed logging (with adjustable log levels) to assist iterative debugging.
  - Use performance testing tools (e.g., Apache JMeter or Artillery for Node.js) to assess the server under load.
  - Identify bottlenecks and optimize API querying logic and server processing pipelines.

**4. Deployment Strategy**

- **Local Development and Repository Management:**
  - Initialize a Git repository in the project directory.
  - Create a well-documented README.md that includes an overview of the project, detailed setup and configuration instructions, API usage, and testing procedures.
  - Draft additional GitHub project management documents:
    - **Contributing Guidelines:** Outline coding standards, commit message formats, and instructions for contributing.
    - **Issue Templates:** Create templates for bug reports and feature requests.
    - **Pull Request Templates:** Standardize code review and PR submission.

- **Deployment Pipeline:**
  - **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    - Set up GitHub Actions (or a similar CI system) to run tests on every commit and pull request.
    - Include linting, unit tests, and integration test steps.
  - **Production Deployment:**
    - Define deployment steps (using tools like Docker, Heroku, or cloud providers such as AWS/Azure/GCP).
    - Document the process for environment variable configuration, scaling policies, and backup procedures.
  - **Monitoring:**
    - Integrate monitoring (e.g., application performance monitoring, error reporting tools) to track the server’s health in production.
