# Backup Procedures for OpenAlex MCP Server

This document outlines the procedures to ensure the safety and integrity of production data and configuration files.

## Data Backup
- Schedule automatic backups for persistent data (e.g., database contents) using your preferred backup tool or cloud service.
- For Docker deployments, regularly back up container volumes to an external storage service.

## Configuration Backup
- Regularly back up critical configuration files (e.g., .env, newrelic.js, Dockerfile) to a secure, version-controlled location.
- Ensure that sensitive information is encrypted or managed securely.

## Disaster Recovery
- Define recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for your services.
- Document a plan to restore services in case of data loss or system failure. This may include:
  - Re-deploying Docker containers from backed-up images.
  - Restoring configuration files and persistent data.
  - Verifying backup integrity periodically.

## Tools and Automation
- Consider using cron jobs or cloud-based backup solutions to automate the backup process.
- Regularly test your backup and restore procedures to ensure they work as expected.
